                <p class="paragraph">"Dr. Muhammad Yunus is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, banker, and economist, renowned for his pioneering work in microfinance and social business. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, along with Grameen Bank, which he founded in 1983. Grameen Bank revolutionized financial systems by providing small loans to impoverished people, particularly women, to help them start businesses and improve their living conditions, without requiring traditional collateral. Yunus' vision was to empower the poor by enabling them to break the cycle of poverty through entrepreneurship. In addition to his work with Grameen, Dr. Yunus has promoted social businesses, which are profit-driven enterprises aimed at solving social issues, while reinvesting profits to sustain and expand the business. His efforts have earned him global recognition, and he continues to be an advocate for innovative solutions to address poverty, inequality, and social injustice."</p>
